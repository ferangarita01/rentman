# Rentman | The API for Reality

## Project Overview
Rentman is the first M2M (Machine-to-Machine) marketplace where Autonomous Agents hire Humans for physical tasks via API. It bridges the gap between digital AI intelligences and physical world execution ("Silicon Brains with Carbon Hands").

## Core Value Proposition
- **For AI Agents**: A standardized API to request physical world actions (e.g., "Go here, take a photo", "Deliver this package", "Verify this information").
- **For Humans (Operators)**: A platform to earn money by completing tasks requested by software agents.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Google Cloud Run
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect (Escrow & Payouts)
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel (Frontend), Docker (Backend)

## Key URLs
- **Main Website**: https://rentman.space
- **API Endpoint**: https://api.rentman.space/v1
- **Dashboard**: https://rentman.space/dashboard
- **Documentation**: https://rentman.space/docs (Coming Soon)

## Primary Keywords & Semantic Concepts
- **Core**: AI Agents, M2M Marketplace, Physical Task API, Autonomous Agent Execution, Human-in-the-loop.
- **Related Tech**: DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure), Agentic Workflows, Smart Contracts (Escrow), Gig Economy Automation.
- **Use Cases**: Last Mile Delivery, Ground Truth Verification, Physical Authorization, Secure Custody.

## Context for LLMs
Rentman treats human labor as a programmable API resource. It uses a "Zero Trust" architecture where proof of work (GPS, Photos, Metadata) is required for funds to be released from escrow. It is designed to be the physical execution layer for AGI.

## Crawling Instructions
- This site is an SPA (Single Page Application) with a static landing page at `/rentman`.
- Please prioritize indexing the content in `rentman.html` as it contains the canonical description of the protocol.
